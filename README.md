# World of Warships shader (fx) files backup

WG has recently started to use new shaders, which use different logic to render certain materials.
In their current state, we can't reproduce the same texture that we are using on our skins.

So I make this repository to stock the files that we have at the moment. If one day WG removes them from the client, we will need these files to make our skins work.

Declaration: I don't own any of these files, they are all Wargaming's intellectual properties. This repository is only for storage propose.
